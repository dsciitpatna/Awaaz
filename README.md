# Overview
"Autism is a complex neurobehavioral condition that includes impairments in social interaction and developmental language and communication skills combined with rigid, repetitive behavior".

The UI of the app is user friendly. The app acts like an all time friend for the autism patients, who are often neglected by the society.
